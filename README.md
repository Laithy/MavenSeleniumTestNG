A script used to test the login functionality available at http://the-internet.herokuapp.com.

I made two test cases for the sake of simplicity, the positive scenario where the user enters the correct password and username, and another negative scenario where the user entered a wrong username and password.

I used Selenium with TestNG to write the scripts for the test cases and check the actual results and compare them with the expected results,
I later implemented POM design pattern for a cleaner code and to be able to make modifications in the future easily,
I then wrote a regression and smoke test XML file.
